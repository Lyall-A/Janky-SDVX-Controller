This firmware uses Serial instead of HID and really should **not** be used, this should work with all microcontrollers that can be flashed using Arduino IDE and support Serial

# Flashing the firmware
* Open the `Janky-SDVX-Controller.ino` file in [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
* Go to `Tools > Board` and select your board
* Go to `Tools > Port` and select your port
* Press `Upload` (`CTRL+U`) to compile and upload the firmware to your board
